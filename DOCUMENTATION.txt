   to capture semantic meaning and contextual relationships
3. Create a scalable architecture that can handle growing datasets without
   performance degradation
4. Integrate advanced filtering capabilities that combine semantic search with
   traditional metadata constraints

TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES:
1. Implement FAISS-based vector similarity search for efficient high-dimensional
   vector operations
2. Utilize Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model for generating rich contextual embeddings
   from multi-field movie metadata
3. Develop a hybrid search approach combining vector similarity with SQL-style
   filtering mechanisms
4. Integrate Cohere Rerank technology for post-search relevance optimization
5. Create a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit for seamless user
   interaction
